## 🔧 System Components

The Key Extraction and Aliasing Workflow consists of three main components:

1. **Key Extraction Module** (`key_extraction/`) - Core extraction functionality
2. **Aliasing Module** (`aliasing/`) - Tag aliasing and transformation
3. **Common Module** (`common/`) - Shared CDF integration components

Each component is documented in detail in the respective API documentation sections.
